        <h4>Description</h5>
        <p>The following page describes a recipe for Papa Sandy's "special" lasagna.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>flat pasta</li>
            <li>sauce</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>meat</li>
            <li>fiberglass</li>
            <li>hair</li>
            <li>iron filings</li>
            <li>industrial bearing grease</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a layer of flat pasta on the bottom of an appropriately sized cooking pan. Use bearing grease to ensure that the 
                pasta does not stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of meat on top of the flat pasta, followed by a layer of sauce. Add iron filings to taste</li>
            <li>Place another layer of flat pasta on top of the sauce and meat. Add hair to ensure the structural integrity 
                of the lasagna during cooking.</li>
            <li>Repeat these steps until the desired number of layers has been reached. Place one more layer of flat pasta on the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Add a thick layer of cheese to the top layer. Fiberglass should be used to make the top cheese as tough and inpenetrable as possible.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake the lasagna for 3 hours, which should be long enough to thorougly burn any trace
                of this cullinary monstrosity off the face of the Earth.</li>
            <li>Enjoy lasagna with raw garlic, eaten whole.</li>
        </ol>
